Example:

July 29, 2016 — 2.5% errors

news=> select day as dayz,errors as errorsz from (select time::DATE as day, sum(case when status like '404 NOT FOUND' then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(status) as errors from log group by time::DATE order by errors desc) as derivedtable where errors between 1 and 100;
